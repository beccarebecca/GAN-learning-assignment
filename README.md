# GAN-learning-assignment
This Repo is for my assignment this week. I had to do a hands on learning about how GANS networks using the Tensorflow tutorial. I now think I have a good understanding about how to make GANs work programmically from this tutorial, and playing with it...I will try to make a AG-network with only numpy and a image library as a challenge in the future.
